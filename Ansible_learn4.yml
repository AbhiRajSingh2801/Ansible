#Modules
#test.yml file are present inside the controller machine
-
      name: this is out first module play
      host: webserver1
      task:
        -
          name: "copy created dummy file in target machine"
          copy: src=test.yml dest=/tmp/

#if module is are defined to particular user group mode then we can write yaml file below:

-     
      name: this is module to copy file into target machine particular user
      hsot: webserver1
      task:
        -
          name: "copy created dummy file in target machine into particular user"
          copy: src=filename dest:/tml/ owner= abhi group=dev mode=0644(permission)

#another way to write 
-     
      name: this is module to copy file into target machine particular user
      hsot: webserver1
      task:
        -
          name: "copy created dummy file in target machine into particular user"
          copy: 
            src=filename 
            dest:/tml/ 
            owner= abhi 
            group=dev 
            mode=0644(permission)
